            <p>
               Singapore, before its modern name, was once known as Temasek. 
               The name Temasek appears in historical records, particularly those of Chinese traders who referred to the settlement as Danmaxi (or Temasik/Temasek). 
               The Malay Annals (Sejarah Melayu) also mention Temasek, alongside the name Singapura. 
               It is believed that the name Singapura was adopted later, possibly around the end of the 14th century.
